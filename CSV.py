#TODO this python file will be used to hold the
# supporting functions distanceBetween(), minDistanceFrom(), and timeToDeliver()
class CSV:

#TODO distanceBetween(address1, address2)
# C.1) Function to return the distance between two addresses:
# 8-Define distanceBetween(address1, address2)
# 9-Return distanceData[addressData.index(address1)][addressData.index(address2)]
# i.e. distances between addresses can be accessed via distanceData[i][j];

#TODO minDistanceFrom(fromAddress, truckPackages)
# C.2) Function to find min distance/address:
# 10-Define minDistanceFrom(fromAddress, truckPackages)
# 11-Return min distance address to fromAddress
# i.e. call distanceBetween(address1, address2) in a loop for all the addresses in the Truck

#TODO timeToDeliver(h)
    def timeToDeliver(h):
        pass #TODO delete later
